    <article>
        I'm 33 years old, living with my life companion Ture. Ture is a 3 month old Staffordshire Bull Terrier. He enjoys biting me and my furniture 
        and I do not enjoy tending to my wounds and wiping up pee puddles.
        
        I enjoy working out with running being the prime focus at the moment. I study mathematics at the bachelor level and attending java programming courses
        at Grit Academy. I work with home care in Lunds kommun.

                Quote that inspire me

            </h2> 
            <blockquote>
                “It is difficult for me to imagine what "personal liberty" is enjoyed by an unemployed person, who goes about hungry, and cannot find employment.
    
                Real liberty can exist only where exploitation has been abolished, where there is no oppression of some by others, where there is no unemployment and poverty,
             where a man is not haunted by the fear of being tomorrow deprived of work, of home and of bread. Only in such a society is real, and not paper, personal and every other liberty possible.”</blockquote>
